# The Hollow Scarecrow
### <i>Inspired by Sarah Simmons’ art piece [‘Scarecrow’](https://www.anthropologyofmotherhood.com/sarah-simmons)</i>

Like a cored out apple, stripped of its inner self,

I see it standing there, an empty shell of womanhood.

It is my reflection, it is my past, present, and future.

Hollowed out, and hanging onto the discarded,

the beauty of giving yourself fully to a life of caregiving.
