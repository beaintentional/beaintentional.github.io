# The Hollow Scarecrow
### <i>Inspired by Sarah Simmons’ art piece [<u>‘Scarecrow’</u>](https://www.anthropologyofmotherhood.com/sarah-simmons)</i>
<l></l>
<l>Like a cored out apple, stripped of its inner self,</l>
<l>I see it standing there, an empty shell of womanhood.</l>
<l>It is my reflection, it is my past, present, and future.</l>
<l>Hollowed out, and hanging onto the discarded,</l>
<l>the beauty of giving yourself fully to a life of caregiving.</l>
