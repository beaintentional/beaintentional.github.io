# The Hollow Scarecrow
### Inspired by Sarah Simmons’ art piece <a href="https://www.anthropologyofmotherhood.com/sarah-simmons" target="_blank">Scarecrow</a>

Like a cored out apple, stripped of its inner self,

I see it standing there, an empty shell of womanhood.

It is my reflection, it is my past, present, and future.

Hollowed out, and hanging onto the discarded,

the beauty of giving yourself fully to a life of caregiving.

# A Quiet Place

There is a noise in my head; persistent, boisterous and maddening.

Its source is not my soul. This is the sound of encroachment.

I’m searching and longing for a quiet place. A space to hear my heart.

Running feels futile. Immobility feels hopeless. Where do I turn?
